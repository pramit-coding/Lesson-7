<p>Pencils are a slender rod of a solid marking substance, such as graphite, enclosed in a cylinder of wood, metal, or plastic used as an implement for writing, drawing, or marking.</p>

<p class="my_class">A pencil is a writing or drawing implement with a solid pigment core in a protective casing that reduces the risk of core breakage. Pencils create marks by physical abrasion, leaving a trail of solid core material that adheres to a sheet of paper or other surface1. They are typically made of wood, metal, plastic, or other materials, and contain a core of graphite or other solid coloring materials.</p>
