    <img src="What-is-Virus-2.jpg">

    <p>A computer virus is a type of malicious software designed to spread between computers and cause damage to data and
    software. It attaches itself to executable host files and executes its code when the file is opened, spreading to other
    programs and systems. Common signs of a computer virus include slow system performance, unexpected pop-up windows,
    programs self-executing, and frequent crashes. Viruses can also send mass emails from your account without your consent.</p>
